# NLP_speech_part_recognition

This repo contains my implementation to several algorithms for part of speech recognition, that are tested on tagged sentences from the "brown" courpus. 
It contains a naive MLE classifier, as well as a Viterbi algorithm implementation (including use of add-1 smoothing and pseudo-words). 
It was written as an assignment in the "Natural Language Processing" course in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Fall semester of 2021.
